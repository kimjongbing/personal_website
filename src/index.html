<a href="https://nx2.site/">https://nx2.site/</a> and <a href="https://dimden.dev/">https://dimden.dev/</a> and <a href="https://denshi.org/">https://denshi.org/</a> are massive inspiration for the design i think ill try to do 
- Homepage
    - Welcome box, again like <a href="https://dimden.dev/">https://dimden.dev/</a> (I just like his site a lot)
    - Blog 
        - Below it has them listed like how <a href="https://dimden.dev/">https://dimden.dev/</a> did it, 
        clicking them takes you to separate page standalone for it. Make sure to have a back button though. 
    - Projects
        - Has them listed like <a href="https://dimden.dev/">https://dimden.dev/</a> did it 

gotta figure out what kinda stylistic approach i want. i really like the aesthetics of dimden and nx2 and the simplicity and cleanliness of nx2 and denshi. 
also the braille font nx2 uses is really nice to read  as well as their site being really good on mobile or seemingly on any other resolution
