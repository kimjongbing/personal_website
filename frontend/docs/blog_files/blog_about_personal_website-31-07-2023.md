# Creation of this website & why I made it
**July 31, 2023**

Learning by explaining and doing is incredibly important. I have been studying Japanese for an extended period, and the "doing" part has been particularly emphasized. I didn't learn Japanese by reading a textbook or watching a tutorial (except for perhaps a few grammar guides like Tae Kim), but rather I learned Japanese through constant exposure, whether that be through reading visual novels, light novels, manga, or listening to anime. Similarly, just a few months ago, I had absolutely no idea how to code anything. My projects have been relatively basic so far, but they have helped me understand the different syntaxes of various languages and their quirks.

But why mention Japanese? Well, with Japanese, I use flashcards (Anki) to continuously expose myself to vocabulary terms to retain them. However, with coding, I only have one component of "constant exposure" (through creating different projects) and no supplementary component like Anki. This is where this website comes in. By explaining how I created my projects, what problems I encountered, what I learned along the way, and detailing it in a way that is reproducible by others, I hope to reinforce the knowledge I've been exposed to and engrain it in myself.

In a future blog post, I will detail how I created this website, the problems I encountered along the way, and how I resolved them. For now, I hope you enjoy the rest of my website!
